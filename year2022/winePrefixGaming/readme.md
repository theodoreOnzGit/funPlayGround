so i find the process of getting a game to work quite fun

thus i'm interested in trying out wine and making wine/lutris bottles for
several games


especially mods of games i like, eg 
twisted insurrection (tiberian sun)
and 
mental omega (red alert 2/YR)

as well as some other games
idk how to get empire at war mods to work on linux steam natively using 
proton
i wonder if using steam in windows will help?
